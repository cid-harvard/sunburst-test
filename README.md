# sunburst-test

## by the Growth Lab at Harvard's Center for International Development

This project contains the code for the rough prototypes for the Sunburst visualizations for [Harvard's Cities Atlas](https://github.com/cid-harvard/cities-atlas-front-end).

### Runnig the prototypes

- To run the prototypes, first `cd` into the root directory and run `npm i`
- Then `cd` into `/example` and run `npm i` there as well
- Then while you are still in `/example` you can run `npm start` and the prototypes will be running off of the specified localhost port

### Deploying the prototypes to Github pages

- Once all of your changes have been committed and pushed, make sure to `cd` into the root directory
- From there, run `npm run deploy` and the prototypes will be built and pushed to Github pages

> **Note:** This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library) purely for the built in structure of rapidly depolying test code to static Github pages. This project is not currently nor intended to become an npm module.
